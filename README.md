# CSH Sensible Constitution Rewrite

This is a "sensible" rewrite of the CSH constitution. The goal of this initiative is to, as objectively as possible:

+ Better reflect our current policies and processes.
+ Remove ambiguous language and/or language that does not reflect the author's otherwise inferable intent and/or does not reflect current policies or processes.
+ Provide a better baseline for the potential future implementation of changes being discussed by the CSH Constitution Committee.
+ To provide a better alternative to re-ratifying our existing constitution should the CSH Constitution Committee fail to meet it's deadline.
